  ### Collective action, at scale, to open trusted content for the public good.


  The foundation of [Big Ten Open Books](http://bigtenopenbooks.org) is collective action including the partnership between university presses and libraries to develop the program’s model, as well as the multi-press collaboration that populates the content. At scale is our aspiration to develop a programmatic, sustainable approach to our work that mirrors the size and impact of our member institutions. To open is the work to create open-access editions that can be read and reused by anyone, anywhere. Trusted content describes the rigorous selection and quality certification process that every title in this collection has undergone. For the public good is one of the north star ideals for the libraries of the Big Ten Academic Alliance. We have a commitment to contribute to building a just, trustworthy, scalable, and sustainable open knowledge ecosystem in order to advance open, more equitable scholarship.

  #### H﻿ow Do We Do That?


  The works in these collections have all been previously published by these presses and have undergone a rigorous selection and quality certification process that allows readers and users of this collection to trust the veracity of the content made available. The exact details of the process depend on the type of book, but usually involve the following steps.


  1. A﻿n acquisitions editor identifies a high quality, interesting project and works with the author to prepare their manuscript for consideration. They work with other experts such as fellow acquisition editors and series editors - scholars with expertise in the field.

  2. O﻿nce the manuscript is ready for outside eyes, it is sent to external experts in the subject matter who conduct a peer review process. They receive honoraria in return for detailed reviews - often several pages in length. The reviewers either do or do not know the identity of the author, but the author never knows the identity of the reviewers unless they opt to waive their anonymity. The presses follow the Association of University Presses ["Best Practices for Peer Review﻿."](https://peerreview.up.hcommons.org/)

  3. T﻿he manuscript and associated peer reviews are examined by an expert editorial board of faculty members at the parent institution of the university press. These experts are selected because of their commitment to academic integrity and are usually the final decision-makers who determine whether the project is accepted for publication. They may require additional rounds of revision and review. Very rarely is a project accepted for publication without additional requests for revision from the editorial board.

  4. O﻿nce all the revisions are done and the manuscript is considered satisfactory for production by the acquisitions editor, it is "transmitted" to the production department of the press. At this point, expert copyeditors and designers take over. Copyediting is an extension of the acquisitions editorial process and involves experts staff checking the work for quality and consistency - making many changes to ensure the book can be the best it can be.

  5. P﻿rint and ebooks are formatted to be accessible to all sorts of readers. A poorly designed print book will not satisfy a reader if images cannot be interpreted or text is not properly rendered. Similarly, a screen reader will not be able to understand an ebook that includes coding errors or does not contain image descriptions.


  E﻿ach book in the Big Ten Open Books collections has been through the hands of multiple experts before it reaches the reader. On average, it costs around $20,000 to produce the first copy of a university press book - a number that is not surprising considering the multiple steps taken to ensure that the work a reader receives can be trusted. There are many good publishers who are not university presses, but only university presses take all five steps of quality assurance described above.
