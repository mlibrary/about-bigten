  ### Collective action, at scale, to open trusted content for the public good.


  The foundation of [Big Ten Open Books](http://bigtenopenbooks.org) is collective action including the partnership between university presses and libraries to develop the program’s model, as well as the multi-press collaboration that populates the content. At scale is our aspiration to develop a programmatic, sustainable approach to our work that mirrors the size and impact of our member institutions. To open is the work to create open-access editions that can be read and reused by anyone, anywhere. Trusted content describes the rigorous selection and quality certification process that every title in this collection has undergone. For the public good is one of the north star ideals for the libraries of the Big Ten Academic Alliance. We have a commitment to contribute to building a just, trustworthy, scalable, and sustainable open knowledge ecosystem in order to advance open, more equitable scholarship.
