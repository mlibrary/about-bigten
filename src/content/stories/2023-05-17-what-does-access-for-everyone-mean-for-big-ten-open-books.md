T﻿he titles made available through Big Ten Open Books are open access. This means they are free-to-read to anyone with an Internet connection. They are also openly-licensed under Creative Commons licenses which make most of the titles free to reuse in any non-commercial ways. All the books can also be downloaded as both PDF and EPUB3 files, meaning that readers can use them offline as well as online. We don't apply any "digital rights management" (DRM), so when you download a file it won't "expire."

W﻿hile PDFs are very familiar, EPUB3 files may be less so. EPUB3 is a World Wide Web consortium standard format that allows publications such as ebooks to be fully part of the Internet environment. One implication of this is that EPUB3 files are fully machine-readable, which means that texts can be resized to work well on different forms of reading devices - from mobile phones to desktop computers. Another implication is that screen-reading software is able to work seamlessly with the file format, which makes reading easier for visually-impaired users or those with different learning styles.

W﻿hile machines can read the text in EPUB3s, they need a bit more help with the images. For this reason, all of the titles in Big Ten Open Books have had visual descriptions of images added - both short-form "alt-text" and longer "described-by" text. Our goal is to make sure that every reader gets the best possible reading and use experience, but we know we will sometimes fall short.
