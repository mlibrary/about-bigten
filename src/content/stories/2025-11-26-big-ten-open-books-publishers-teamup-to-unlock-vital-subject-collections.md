University Press Week was established by President Jimmy Carter in 1978 “in recognition of the impact, both here and abroad, of American university presses on culture and scholarship.” It takes place in November.

This year’s [UP Week](https://aupresses.org/events/university-press-week-2025/) theme was #TeamUP. The theme encourages us to celebrate all of the staff, scholars, librarians, organizations, partner presses, and the many others in our networks that allow us to pursue our shared mission of disseminating scholarly content far and wide. 

The Big Ten Open Book project is dedicated to promoting open scholarship through the development of open book collections of curated scholarly monographs published by university presses.

The [Gender and Sexuality Studies](https://www.fulcrum.org/bigten?f%5Bseries_sim%5D%5B%5D=Gender+and+Sexuality+Studies&locale=en) and [Indigenous North Americans](https://www.fulcrum.org/bigten?f%5Bseries_sim%5D%5B%5D=Indigenous+North+Americans&locale=en) collections were made possible by financial support from the Big Ten Academic Alliance-affiliated libraries, and contain books contributed by the ten collaborating Big Ten Academic Alliance-affiliated university presses.

This involved extensive collaboration between the presses, the libraries, and the Michigan Publishing staff (the collections are hosted on Michigan Publishing’s [Fulcrum platform](https://www.fulcrum.org/bigten?locale=en)). Rights and permissions needed to be cleared, library sponsorship was secured, contracts were negotiated, book data was gathered and enhanced, and then finally the ebook files were created using a [Benetech Certified Global Accessible](https://bornaccessible.benetech.org/global-certified-accessible/) workflow to meet WCAG 2AA standards. It was crucial to #TeamUP and share the work required to make these vital subject area collections accessible to today’s readers.

### Supporting Statements

When asked about the benefit of teaming up and creating a sustainable platform for open scholarship, directors from participating university presses had a lot of great things to say.

“Through the Big Ten Open Books initiative, Penn State University Press is helping to reimagine how scholarship circulates in the digital age. Open access ensures that our authors’ ideas travel farther, informing conversations and discoveries well beyond the academy.”\
- David Aycock, Executive Director, Penn State University Press

“It’s a privilege to be a part of the Big Ten Academic Alliance. We tend to think of the Big Ten in terms of athletic achievement and excellence, but the Big Ten Academic Alliance —and especially Big Ten Open Books—creates BIG opportunities for achievement and excellence in scholarly communication and research as well. By banding together, the presses and libraries of the Big Ten can offer powerhouse open access collections better than any one institution can do on its own. Big Ten Open Books helps MSU Press fulfill its commitments to scholarly communities across the Midwest, the nation, and throughout the world.”\
- Elizabeth Demers, Director, Michigan State University Press

“The Big Ten Open Books partnership underscores how much we can achieve when university presses collaborate with purpose. For University of Nebraska Press, making rigorous, field-defining work freely accessible isn’t simply good publishing practice, it’s good citizenship.”\
- Jane Ferreyra, Director, University of Nebraska Press

“Through Big Ten Open Books, university presses and libraries #TeamUP to expand access to high-quality scholarship, removing geographic and financial barriers to research and learning. This unique collaboration demonstrates our shared commitment to students, to scholars, and to the public good.”\
- Michelle Sybert, Director, University of Illinois Press

“Big Ten Open Books is a tangible way in which university presses are partnering with libraries, our sister campus experts on scholarly communication, under the big tent, which is the Big Ten. The collaboration resets traditional roles, where publishers sell and libraries buy, to create a partnership in process that benefits both authors and readers.”\
- Charles Watkinson, Director, University of Michigan Press
