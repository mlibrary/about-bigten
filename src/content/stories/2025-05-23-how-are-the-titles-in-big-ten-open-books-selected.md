Big Ten Open Books was initiated in 2022. An extensive process of survey and discussion identified a group of Interdisciplinary themes. The collections reflect themes that both librarians and presses within the Big Ten Academic Alliance identified as important.

After analysis of books in their collections conducted by BTAA, a “wish list” of titles published by the Big Ten University Presses were developed. BTAA presses were approached to see whether they would be interested in participating in a collection and either opted in or opted out. The main reason for opting out was that the press's subject focuses were not relevant to the topic being considered. The majority of Big Ten presses have participated in at least one collection. 10 presses are, for example, participating in Collections 3-5.

The standard due diligence workflow adopted by presses for rounding down the requested titles to ones they are able to include in the collection involves a mix of (a) reaching out to authors; (b) checking contracts; (c) checking sales life cycles. When authors have passed away or are out of contact, some presses have needed to rely on contractual terms alone. 

As well as responding to the library requests, presses have also supplemented library wish lists with their own suggestions. All books included have to have appeared under a university press imprint, and thus have been through the quality assurance process typically employed by university presses.
