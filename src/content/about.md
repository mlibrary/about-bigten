The Big Ten Open Ebooks collection is a collaboration between the university presses and libraries of the Big Ten Academic Alliance. The first collection, published in June of 2023, is on the subject of Gender and Sexuality Studies. Participating presses include Indiana University Press, Michigan State University Press, Northwestern University Press, Purdue University Press, University of Michigan Press, and University of Wisconsin-Madison Press.

This collection has established a model for unified, open access publishing of scholarly monographs. It creates open content, on open infrastructure, using open distribution models - to envision a robust programmatic future for open monograph publishing. This work is aligned with the Big Ten Academic Allianceâ€™s development of the [BIG Collection](https://btaa.org/library/big-collection/the-big-collection-introduction)'s work to unite the collections of the libraries of the Big Ten Academic Alliance.
