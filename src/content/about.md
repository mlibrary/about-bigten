Welcome to Big Ten Open Books, a collaboration between the university presses and libraries of the Big Ten Academic Alliance. This collaboration is dedicated to promoting open scholarship through a curated collection of open access scholarly monographs. Driven by the core values of discoverability, accessibility, durability, and flexibility, the project aims to transform how academic resources are shared and used. By emphasizing discoverability, we make it easy for scholars and readers to find the information they need. Accessibility ensures that everyone, no matter their background or location, can freely access this rich knowledge base. Durability preserves this knowledge for the long haul, while flexibility allows it to meet diverse academic needs.

The first Big Ten Open Books (BTOB) project was launched in 2023 as a collection of 100 open access books on Gender and Sexuality Studies. To start reading in the Gender and Sexuality Studies collection while we work on the 2025-2026 open book collections, click [here](https://www.fulcrum.org/bigten).

Participating presses include University of Illinois Press, Indiana University Press, Michigan State University Press, University of Minnesota Press, University of Nebraska Press, Northwestern University Press, The Ohio State University Press, Penn State University Press, Purdue University Press, University of Michigan Press, and University of Wisconsin Press.

This collection has established a model for unified, open-access publishing of scholarly monographs. It creates open content, on open infrastructure, using open distribution models - to envision a robust programmatic future for open monograph publishing. This work is aligned with the Big Ten Academic Alliance’s development of the [BIG Collection's ambition of uniting the collections of the libraries](https://btaa.org/library/big-collection/the-big-collection-introduction) of the Big Ten Academic Alliance.

The [Big Ten Academic Alliance continues its advocacy for a sustainable and open ecosystem of publication.](https://btaa.org/about/news-and-publications/news/2019/06/10/sustaining-values-and-scholarship-a-statement-by-the-provosts-of-the-big-ten-academic-alliance) Collectively, our institutions’ more than 50,000 faculty are supported by over $11 billion in research funding, and our institutions have similarly invested significantly in our capacity to further our missions to advance knowledge. Together, we produce roughly 15% of the research publications in the United States.
