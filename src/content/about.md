Welcome to Big Ten Open Books, a collaboration between the university presses and libraries of the Big Ten Academic Alliance. We are dedicated to promoting open scholarship through the curation of open book collections from scholarly monographs published by our university presses.

Driven by the core values of discoverability, accessibility, durability, and flexibility, the project aims to transform how academic resources are shared and used. By emphasizing discoverability, we make it easy for scholars and readers to find the information they need. Accessibility ensures that everyone, no matter their affiliation or location, can freely access these publications. Durability preserves this knowledge through technological and accessibility advancement. Flexibility allows the Big Ten Open books project to support diverse interests across an everchanging scholarly landscape. 

The first Big Ten Open Books (BTOB) project was launched in 2023 as a collection of 100 open access books on Gender and Sexuality Studies. To start reading in the Gender and Sexuality Studies collection while we work on our upcoming 2025-2026 open book collections, click [here](https://www.fulcrum.org/bigten).

The BTOB project has established a model for unified, open-access publishing of scholarly monographs. It creates open content, on open infrastructure, using open distribution models - to envision a robust programmatic future for open monograph publishing. This work is aligned with the Big Ten Academic Alliance’s development of the [BIG Collection's ambition of uniting the collections of the libraries](https://btaa.org/library/big-collection/the-big-collection-introduction) of the Big Ten Academic Alliance.

The [Big Ten Academic Alliance continues its advocacy for a sustainable and open ecosystem of publication.](https://btaa.org/about/news-and-publications/news/2019/06/10/sustaining-values-and-scholarship-a-statement-by-the-provosts-of-the-big-ten-academic-alliance) Collectively, our institutions’ more than 50,000 faculty are supported by over $11 billion in research funding, and our institutions have similarly invested significantly in our capacity to further our missions to advance knowledge. Together, we produce roughly 15% of the research publications in the United States.
